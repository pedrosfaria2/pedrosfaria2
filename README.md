# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pedro Serrano Faria and I am a Data Science student at UNIVESP. In addition, I am pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. My academic and professional journey has led me through various areas, including finance, mechanical engineering, and now programming. I recently decided to dive headfirst into the fascinating world of Information and Communication Technology.

I am passionate about Data Science, Statistics, Mathematics, and Programming. I love the feeling of solving complex puzzles, discovering hidden insights in data, and developing efficient solutions through programming.

Currently, I am looking for opportunities to apply and expand my knowledge. Whether itâ€™s an internship, a collaborative project, or a full-time position, I am open to exploring all possibilities.

In addition, I have a passion for learning. I am always looking for ways to challenge myself and acquire new skills. I believe that learning is a continuous process and that every experience offers an opportunity for personal and professional growth.

Feel free to get in touch if you want to discuss opportunities, collaborations, or just exchange ideas!!
