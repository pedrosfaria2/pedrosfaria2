# < hey, i'm pedro /> 👾

backend dev who digs building cool stuff. math nerd turned programmer, currently juggling code and grad studies at UC Boulder.

## what's my deal?

started with math at USP, ran some factories, played with high-frequency trading, and now i'm all about that backend life. turns out programming is just math in disguise, and i'm cool with that.

## tech stack? something like:

```python
def current_skills():
    return {
        "main_weapons": ["python", "typescript", "node"],
        "side_quests": ["rust", "c#", "java", "kotlin"],
        "daily_tools": ["fastapi", "flask", "nestjs"],
        "interests": ["system design", "performance", "clean code"]
    }
```

## these days i'm...

- crafting apis and microservices
- diving deep into computer science at UC Boulder
- learning more about data science at UNIVESP
- probably breaking something while trying to optimize it

## when i'm not coding...

actually, who am i kidding? i'm usually still coding. but sometimes i'm reading about new tech or tinkering with rust just for fun.

## let's connect

got ideas? want to collaborate? or just chat about tech? hit me up:
